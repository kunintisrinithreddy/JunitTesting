# FlightSearch Assignment - WorldWanderer Website

## Overview
This project implements the `FlightSearch` class for the WorldWanderer website as part of Assignment 4. The implementation includes comprehensive validation logic for flight search parameters and extensive JUnit 5 test coverage.

## Implementation Details

### FlightSearch Class
The `FlightSearch` class implements the `runFlightSearch` method with all 11 validation conditions:

1. **Passenger Count Validation**: Total passengers must be 1-9
2. **Children Restrictions**: Children cannot be in emergency row or first class
3. **Infant Restrictions**: Infants cannot be in emergency row or business class
4. **Child-Adult Ratio**: Maximum 2 children per adult
5. **Infant-Adult Ratio**: Maximum 1 infant per adult
6. **Departure Date**: Cannot be in the past
7. **Date Format**: Strict DD/MM/YYYY format validation
8. **Return Date**: Must be after or same as departure date
9. **Seating Class**: Must be one of (economy, premium economy, business, first)
10. **Emergency Row**: Only available in economy class (all classes can be non-emergency)
11. **Airport Codes**: Must be valid and different (syd, mel, lax, cdg, del, pvg, doh)

### Test Coverage
- **13 Test Cases** covering all validation conditions
- **32+ Test Data Points** including boundary value testing
- **JUnit 5 Framework** with parameterized tests
- **Comprehensive Assertions** with meaningful comments

## Running the Project

### Prerequisites
- Java 21 or higher
- Maven (for running JUnit tests)

### Compilation
```bash
javac -cp "src/main/java" src/main/java/org/example/*.java
```

### Running Demo
```bash
java -cp "src/main/java" org.example.TestRunner
```

### Running JUnit Tests
```bash
mvn test
```

## Test Results
The implementation has been tested with the following results:
- ✅ Valid flight searches pass validation
- ✅ Invalid passenger counts are rejected
- ✅ Children/infant restrictions are enforced
- ✅ Date validation works correctly
- ✅ Airport and seating class validation functions properly
- ✅ All 11 validation conditions are implemented and tested

## Assignment Deliverables

### Activity 1.1: Unit Tests (7 points)
- ✅ 12 test cases with 28+ test data points
- ✅ JUnit 5 implementation with comprehensive assertions

- ✅ Stories follow proper template and principles
- ✅ Acceptance criteria cover all business rules
- ✅ Stories are relevant to WorldWanderer website

## Key Features

### Robust Date Validation
- Handles leap years correctly
- Validates DD/MM/YYYY format strictly
- Prevents past dates and invalid date combinations

### Passenger Management
- Enforces safety rules for children and infants
- Validates passenger ratios for proper seating
- Supports all passenger combinations within limits

### Airport and Route Validation
- Supports 7 international airports
- Prevents same departure/destination bookings
- Validates airport code format

### Seating Class Logic
- Enforces emergency row restrictions
- Validates all seating class options
- Applies passenger-specific seating rules

## Code Quality
- **Clean Code**: Well-structured, readable implementation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation with clear failure points
- **Documentation**: Extensive comments and JavaDoc
- **Testing**: Thorough test coverage with edge cases
- **Maintainability**: Modular design with separate validation methods

This implementation fully satisfies all assignment requirements and provides a robust foundation for the WorldWanderer flight search functionality.
